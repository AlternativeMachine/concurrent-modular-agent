It allows developers to create agents that can perform multiple things simultaneously as concurrent modules. This makes the way of building agents a bit different from the traditional way of building agents as workflows. </p> <p>To get started with CoMA, you can follow the steps in Getting Started.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/connecting-modules/","title":"3.
